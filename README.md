# CHAIN_IHME_under5_sysreview
Code repository for analysis of systematic review materials. 

clean.R is the primary script to clean and plot the data from the systematic review. It calls the cleaning_fxns code. MR-BRT requires a specific python environment to be run, and as it becomes publicly available, I can link to materials instructing how to install it. For now, you can follow my code to see how my analysis takes shape. 

Locs is a reference doc containing the GBD hierarchy.
